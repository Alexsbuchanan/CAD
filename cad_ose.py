        This function updates the contexts of the left and right side based
        on the dictionary 'facts' that are passed. It is called internally by
        the get anomaly score function, but may be called if you do not want
        an anomaly score and only wish to train the NN.

        It first creates potential new facts to append to the left side at the
        zeroth level. (TODO: What is zero level?)
        Then it runs a cross context operator on the RHS contexts. This resets
        the contexts on the right hand side and returns the activated contexts,
        the number of selected contexts, the potential new contexts and the
        number of contexts.

        The number of unique potential contexts are calculated.

        The percent of selected contexts that are active is also calculated. If
        there were so selected contexts it defaults to 0.

        The active contexts are then sorted by how often they were activated,
        (lowest -> highest). The maximum amount of neurons (user defined) are
        selected and their context ID's are converted to facts via the
        operation:
        .. math:
            F \equals \{2^{31} + fact \rvert fact \in N\}
        Where here N is the set of active neuron facts, and F is the new set
        of facts.
        The left side is then updated with these new facts, and sorted from
        lowest to highest. We then do a cross context of facts on the left,
        yielding the number of new contexts and the predictions it yielded.
